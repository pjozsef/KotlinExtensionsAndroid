#KotlinExtensionsAndroid

A simple repo containing some Android specific extension methods.

##Usage
To use this these set of extension methods in your project, you need to locally build it with `./gradlew install`, so the artifact gets installed into your local maven repository.

Once you are done with it, you can declare it as a dependency.

Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.pjozsef</groupId>
  <artifactId>kotlin-extensions-android</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:
```groovy
compile 'com.github.pjozsef:kotlin-extensions-android:0.0.1'
```
